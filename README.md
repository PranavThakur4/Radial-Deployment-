# Radial-Deployment-
 A novel, non-pyrotechnic payload deployment mechanism tailored for sounding rockets is introduced in this research paper. The
 mechanism addresses the challenge of efficiently and compactly deploying payloads radially during a single launch, featuring a
 cylindrical carrier structure actuated by a rack-pinion mechanism. Powered by a servo motor, the carrier structure translates to en
able radial ejection of payloads. The paper presents the mechanism’s design and conducts a comprehensive performance analysis,
 including structural stability, system dynamics and power requirements. A simulation model is developed to assess payload deploy
ment behavior under various conditions, demonstrating the mechanism’s viability and efficiency for deploying multiple payloads
 within a single sounding rocket launch. The mechanism’s adaptability to accommodate diverse payload types, sizes and weights
 enhances its versatility, while its radial deployment capability allows payloads to be released at different altitudes, offering greater
 flexibility for scientific experiments. The paper concludes that this innovative payload radial deployment mechanism represents a
 significant advancement in sounding rocket technology and holds promise for a wide array of applications in both scientific and
 commercial missions.
